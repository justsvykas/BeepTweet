# Experiments

This folder has all the experiments carried out to find the best model to detect VAD values from text

## Contains

- Linear_Ridge_regressions_experiments.ipynb <br>
Here we show how we chose Ridge regression over Linear regression
- NN_RNN_experiments.ipynb <br>
Here we show my experiments with NN and RNN and calculate whether they are a good fit for the task
- Dev_and_hypertuning.ipynb <br>
Here we introduce Development split and then hyper tune this way finding best parameters for our model.
- Combining_datasets.ipynb <br>
Here we combine datasets while doing EDA on the way. Looking at pros/cons of combining datasets.
