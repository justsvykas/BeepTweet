# Emotion detection from text into VAD values

In this folder you can find:
- Main_Ridge_regression.ipynb <br>
This is the main model which we used to put emotions from text into VAD values.
- All csv files are the ones used for the main model
- Experiments folder is created to show how we arrived at at the final version of our VAD model
- Main folder has saved model so emotion detection would go as fast as possible when creating music
